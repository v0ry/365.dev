"However, what does it mean to be good?"

To be good at something means we know what we are doing. If we know what we are doing, that means that we are experienced with this topic. Experience means we have a vast repertoire in this field. Repertoire comes from associations and practical experience. When we say practical experience, we want to know how much we have to practice to become competent at a specific task.
