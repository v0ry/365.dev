todayIlearned: Today I learned how to use `yt-dlp` with cookies for automated batch downloads, log output, and archive downloads. I also explored recursive directory copying in Linux using `find`, focusing on how `-maxdepth` controls the depth and how to mirror file structures while copying.

# How to use `yt-dlp` with cookies for batch downloads

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <url or batch file>"
  exit 1
fi

INPUT="$1"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
LOGFILE="/home/pi/yt-dlp-logs/download_$TIMESTAMP.log"
ARCHIVE="/home/pi/yt-dlp-logs/downloaded.txt"

mkdir -p /home/pi/yt-dlp-logs

CMD=(sudo yt-dlp
  --cookies /home/pi/Documents/Cookies/cookies.txt
  --download-archive "$ARCHIVE"
  -f "bestvideo[width<1280]+bestaudio[language='en']"
  --merge-output-format mp4
  -o "/mnt/sda/%(uploader)s/%(upload_date)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s"
)

if [[ -f "$INPUT" ]]; then
  CMD+=(--batch-file "$INPUT")
else
  CMD+=("$INPUT")
fi

{
  echo "===== Starting Download: $(date) ====="
  echo "Input: $INPUT"
  echo "--------------------------------------"
  "${CMD[@]}"
  RESULT=$?
  echo "===== Download Finished: $(date) ====="

  if [ "$RESULT" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo -e "\a"
  else
    echo "Download failed. Exit code: $RESULT"
  fi

  exit $RESULT
} | tee "$LOGFILE"

# [Copy recursively X folders deep linux - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25513461/copy-recursively-x-folders-deep-linux)

| Q                                                                                                  | A                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What does the command `find src-dir/ -maxdepth 2 -type d -exec mkdir -p dest_dir/{} \;` do?        | It finds all directories up to two levels deep in the source and creates them (with the same relative paths) in the destination.    |
| In the directory creation command, what does `-maxdepth 2` mean?                                   | It limits the search to the source directory (level 0) and its immediate subdirectories (level 1), plus their children (level 2).   |
| What is the purpose of the command `find src_dir/ -maxdepth 3 -type f -exec cp {} dest_dir/{} \;`? | It finds and copies all files from the source up to three levels deep into the destination.                                         |
| Why might the copying command with `-maxdepth 3` copy files from deeper folder levels?             | Because using `-maxdepth 3` includes files in subdirectories beyond the first-level folders, resulting in extra files being copied. |
| How could you modify the file copying command to restrict copying to one folder deep?              | By changing `-maxdepth 3` to `-maxdepth 2` so that only files in the source and its immediate subdirectories are copied.            |

> 💡 _Using `find` with `-maxdepth` allows precise control over how deep the command searches or acts on folders and files._
